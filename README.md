# Miniex6 - I'm not done writing yet! 
I have made a generative program using the random function, a  for loop and conditional statements. I also used the principle of classes and objects which we learned last week. The rules of my program are: 

1. The circles are generated at random positions.  
2. The circles are generated in random colors. 
3. The circles are generated in random sizes. 
4. The circles move forwards along the x-axis until they hit the edge of the screen
5. When the circles hit the edge of the screen they go backwards with a slight drop in the y-axis causing them to move diagonally. 

The circles keep going back and forwards leaving trails of the previous circle, making a pattern as they go. When they exit the canvas at the bottom the program stops generating annything new.

I created this program with help from some of my classmates. I had the initial idea. But the program runs randomly everytime you refresh the browser. The program is rather independent. Once it is made, it has a life of it's own. I don't decide where the circles go each time. I only decided the rules in which the program is "allowed" to operate. In some ways I control it and in other ways I don't. Thinking about these different concepts we've talked about this week, I couldn't help drawing a parallel to DNA. Our appearrance is decided according to what's in our DNA.DNA cotains the basic "rules" to our existence. Although this does not mean that we can't change the way we look. My DNA determined that I have brown hair. But not the lenght or style of my hair, and I can even change my haircolour if I want to. Without actually changing the rules (DNA) in can change my appearance entirely. And that is kind of the same thing with generative programs. I'm not saying it is the exact same thing, but I find it very interesting that computer programs are created and then they can run independently without any further interference, like we as humans do. Not as independent in every aspects but in some ways at least. Generative programs are so different from every other type of artwork that we can create. No painted canvas can suddenly change its appearance independently, nor can a drawing. The idea of the fact that you can predict the outcomes of something you created yourself is both exciting and scary at the same time. When it comes to generative programs such as this, it might not be that scary. In terms of AI it's a different story. If we come to live in a world where that relies on AI and we suddenly lost our control over it, what would happen? And i know this sounds like the plot of a clich√© sci-fi movie, but let me put it in a different way; What if all electricity didn't work all of a sudden? A huge part of our society runs on electricity, and everything would fall apart if we didn't have it anymore. I know that I'm a bit off topic here, but I just think it's interesting how delicate the structure of our daily lives actually is.
